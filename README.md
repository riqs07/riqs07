### Hi there 👋

### Coding is my superpower 🦸🏾‍♂️🧙🏾‍♂️
Software got us to the moon. Software will get us to mars. From CGI in the Avengers to 3D scanning at the dentists' office. Software is all around us. Software has and will continue to get us unbelievable places. I want to be a part of that; I want to contribute to the creation of ethical software.

I am a software developer with experience working with various JavaScript technologies such as React, NodeJS, and Express. Hands on experience building and consuming mainly RESTful web services. I am familiar with SQL databases, ORM frameworks like Sequelize and NoSQL Databases like mongoDB. I also have some exposure writing tests all along the testing pyramid inside of the Jest Testing Framework.  Other than JavaScript, I have knowledge of Java, SQL, HTML, CSS,and minimal exposure to C++ and Python.
