### Hi there 👋

### Coding is my superpower 🦸🏾‍♂️🧙🏾‍♂️
Code got us to the moon. Code will get us to mars. From CGI in the Avengers to 3D scanning at the dentists' office. Software is all around us. It has and will continue to get us unbelievable places. I want to be a part of that; I want to help change the world throguh to the creation of ethical software.

I am a software developer with experience working with various technologies. The core of my developer toolkit is JavaScript and Java. I am experianced using several popular JavaScript frameworks such as React, NodeJS, and Express. Hands on experience building and consuming mainly RESTful web services. I am familiar with SQL databases, ORM frameworks like Sequelize and NoSQL Databases like mongoDB. I also have some exposure writing tests all along the testing pyramid inside of the JUnit Testing Framework. Some of the other tools I work with on a regular basis include maven,docker and postman.
