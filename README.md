### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Coding is my superpower 

From getting humans to the moon to helping to helping doctors and dentists with 3D scanning. Software has gotten us to unbeliavable places. 

I am a software developer with experience working with various JavaScript technologies such as React, NodeJS, TypeScript and Express. Hands on experience building and consuming RESTful API's.I am familiar with SQL databases, ORM frameworks like Sequelize and NoSQL Databases like mongoDB. I also have some exposure working within the Jest Testing Framework.  Other than JavaScript, I have knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS,and minimal exposure with Java & Python.
