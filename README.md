### Hello 👋🏾 


I am a developer who is passionate about building applications that bring communities together.

As a full stack developer, I have experience building, deploying and maintaining software applications.


- 🌱 I’m learning how to deploy and manage services using K8s
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a static file analysis application.
- 🐰 Pet Peeve: People misusing the 1-10 rating scale.
